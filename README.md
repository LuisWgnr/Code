This code was created as part of a scientific project to research the use of GitHub Copilot in pair programming. 
The resulting WebApp represents the basic framework of an app that calls up and displays the data of a blockchain for the verification of energy quantities. 
This blockchain was created as part of the EnBW AG b2e2 project and published at “https://github.com/B2E2”. 

The code can be tested after cloning this repo by setting up a basic local server (command for IDE Terminal: "python -m http.server" // python has to be installed) and calling it up in a browser and opening “app.html”.
